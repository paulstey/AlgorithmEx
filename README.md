## AlgorithmEx
This repo houses some simple examples of interesting algorithms written in C++. The current contents include:
- `pisano_period.cpp` This program generates the length of the [Pisano Period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisano_period) for a given modulo.

- `factional_knapsack.cpp` This program solves the [fractional knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_knapsack_problem) for a user-supplied set of values and weights.

- `square_root.cpp` This program is an example of how Newton's method can be used for obtaining square roots.

- `prime_sieve.cpp` This program is an implementation of the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) for finding prime numbers.
