## AlgorithmEx
This repo houses some simple examples of interesting algorithms written in C++. The current contents include:
- `pisano_period.cpp` This program generates the length of the [Pisano Period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisano_period) for a given modulo.

- `factional_knapsack.cpp` This program solves the [fractional knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_knapsack_problem) for a user-supplied set of values and weights.

- `square_root.cpp` This program is an example of how Newton's method can be used for obtaining square roots.

- `prime_sieve.cpp` This program is an implementation of the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) for finding prime numbers.

- `randomwalk.cpp` In this program we compute the probability of a particle in N-dimensional space returning to the origin after some number of steps. The particle moves -1 or 1 in each direction (i.e., dimension) at each step. For dimensions 1 and 2, the probability is 1. In three dimensions, the probability is about 0.34, and as dimensions increase, the probability decreases.
